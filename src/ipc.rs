//! The window and its daemon (`edualc --daemon`), speaking over a Unix socket that only they
//! reach.
//!
//! - The socket lives in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/edualc`, a folder of the user's alone (0700), which is
//!   checked through the descriptor it was opened by, never followed through a link, and used by
//!   that descriptor from then on: binding and connecting go through `/proc/self/fd/<folder>`, so
//!   no path can be swapped in between. Never an abstract socket, which anyone may take first.
//! - Who is the daemon is decided by a lock held as long as it runs: only its holder removes a
//!   stale socket and binds anew, so two starting at once can't both bind, nor one unbind the
//!   other's.
//! - Each peer is checked as it connects: a window, to be the same user running this same
//!   program; the daemon, which makes itself non-dumpable (its `/proc` entries closed to the
//!   user's other processes), to be the same user, in the place only the daemon binds.
//! - Messages are postcard (compact serde), each COBS-framed by postcard: a frame longer than
//!   one of [`MAX_MESSAGE`] ends the connection once the reader's fixed buffer is full, as does
//!   a message that doesn't parse. Nothing in a message makes the reader hold more than that.
