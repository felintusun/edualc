**A native Linux desktop window for Claude Code.**

edualc runs the `claude` program you already have. Your sign-in, settings, CLAUDE.md, skills,
hooks, MCP servers and sessions all work as they do in the terminal, and you can move a session
between the terminal and the window at any time. The window is made for reading Claude's work and
steering it.

**[Try it in your browser](https://felintusun.github.io/edualc/)**: the real window, compiled to
WebAssembly, with a demo project. A script plays Claude, so nothing you type leaves the page.

## What you get

- **You see what a folder would run before it runs.** If you haven't trusted a folder yet, the
  window lists its hooks, MCP servers and environment variables before Claude Code starts there.
- **A conversation you can read.** Markdown is rendered, and you can select and copy all of it.
  Tool calls show as cards with diffs, and a run of them folds into one line.
- **Permission buttons you can't misclick.** Allow, deny and say what to do instead, or always
  allow with the exact rule shown. The buttons respond only a moment after a request appears, and
  each answer goes to the request it was meant for.
- **Plans you review like a document.** Comment on any heading, paragraph or list item. Then send
  Claude back to planning, or approve the plan with your comments attached.
- **All your sessions in one list.** The sidebar shows the sessions running in any terminal or
  folder and what each is doing, and you get a notification when one needs you. A session that is
  working or waiting for you keeps running when you close its window.
- **Side questions on the side.** `/btw` answers in a panel next to the conversation, which carries
  on meanwhile.
- **A native app.** It's built with Rust and Slint, with no browser engine, and it does almost
  nothing while nothing changes. You can reach every control with the keyboard, screen readers can
  read the window, and it follows your desktop's light or dark setting and text size.

## Install

You need Linux with Wayland, and Claude Code installed and signed in (`claude` on your PATH).

There is no release yet. Until there is, build the main branch: on Arch with `makepkg -si` in
[`dist/aur/edualc-git`](dist/aur/edualc-git), anywhere else as described under
[Building](#building).

Releases will have packages for x86_64 and aarch64:

- **Debian 12+, Ubuntu 24.04+:** `sudo apt install ./edualc_*.deb`
- **Fedora, AlmaLinux 10:** `sudo dnf install ./edualc-*.rpm`
- **Arch:** `makepkg -si` in [`dist/aur/edualc`](dist/aur/edualc)
- **Other distributions:** the tarball has the program, its desktop entry and its icon.

To paste images, install `wl-clipboard` too.

## Use

```sh
edualc [DIR] [PROMPT]
edualc --resume SESSION
edualc --backend agy DIR
```

`edualc --help` lists every option. Your settings are in `~/.config/edualc/settings.json`.

`--backend agy` runs Google's Antigravity CLI instead of Claude Code. It needs `agy` on your PATH.
In the window, the New session button asks which of the two to start.

**Coming from an earlier version?** Earlier versions ran Claude Code in a sandbox. Now Claude Code
runs exactly as it does in your terminal. Sessions that ran in the sandbox kept their memory,
plans, todos and file history in `~/.local/state/edualc/claude/<project>/`. edualc leaves that
folder alone, so you can copy anything you still need from it. Their transcripts are already in
`~/.claude`.

## Known limits

- Jumping to another session's window works only on niri.
- You can't mention files with `@` yet, and you paste images rather than drag them in.
- edualc builds Slint from a fork, until the features it needs are in a Slint release.

## Building

Run `cargo build --release`. [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) explains how the code
is laid out and how a release is made.

## License

GPL-3.0-or-later ([LICENSE](LICENSE)). edualc uses Slint under its GPL-3.0-only option, so a
built edualc is distributed under GPL-3.0.
