//! edualc's window, apart from how it is drawn: the conversation with Claude Code (spoken to in
//! stream-json, as the Agent SDKs speak to it), the one owner of its state (`app`), what of it a
//! window shows (`present`), and the line to the daemon that runs Claude Code and reads its
//! files (`ipc`, `link`). The Slint window and the Dioxus page are frontends of it; the daemon
//! (`edualc-host`) shares its types and what only Linux has (`#[cfg(not(target_arch =
//! "wasm32"))]`), which a page leaves out.
