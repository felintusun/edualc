//! The Android app: the page's window (`web`), drawn by Dioxus in Android's WebView, and run by
//! native code rather than in a browser. It reaches an edualcd over the network as a page does,
//! but natively (`edualc_core::line`: TLS, edualcd's certificate pinned, reached again as the
//! network comes back, its name looked up anew), from the edualcds it was paired with
//! (`ipc::servers`, kept in the app's own files, out of Android's backups). Before the window
//! shows, its start screen lists them and pairs with another by the address edualcd prints
//! (`edualcd --pair`); a demo's address (`edualcd --demo`) is taken too, and the window says
//! its line is unencrypted. What the window does on the phone itself (a link opened, a
//! notification, the clipboard) is Android's (`java`).
//!
//! The window works where its edualcd's home folder is, or opens the session it last showed
//! there again (Android ends an app in the background, and starts it anew as it comes back);
//! it opens other folders from its list, as the page does. Closing it (the settings' "Choose
//! another edualcd") goes back to the start screen.

// Dioxus's `rsx!` keeps its templates in `OnceLock`s: its state, not ours (as in `web`).
